## Project description

This project shows how to implement D3 library with ReactJS 

The ###`BarChart` component shows the old fashioned way (giving control of the SVG to the D3 library)

In comparision The ###`WorldMap` component shows how to make changes in the SVG taking the data with D3 and then 
using ReactJS to manipulate DOM.

Happy hacking!
